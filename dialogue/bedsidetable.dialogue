~ bedside_table

A bedside table, complete with a reading lamp. And a drawer with a heavy duty numeric combination lock. 
Not sketchy at all. 

- examine the lock
	set GlobalManager.examiningBSLock = true
- examine the lamp
        Player: itâ€™s a lamp, possibly a cheap one. 
- Leave
	set GlobalManager.inRoom = true
